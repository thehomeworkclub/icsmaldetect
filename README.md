# ICS Malware Detection based on ANIMA for anomaly detection

The purpose of this project is to provide a method for ICS administrators to detect malware based on anomalies from their sensor readings. 
## The Problem

In 2010, the Nuclear Facility in Natanz, Iran was attacked by the Stuxnet malware. This malware was able to manipulate the centrifuges and avoid detection in the facility to causing over 1,000 centrifuges to fail. Stuxnet also infected over 200,000 machines worldwide. 

## Features
* Sensor Analysis: ICSMalDetect will analyze the sensor readings from the ICS network to detect anomalies.
